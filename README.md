This project was worked on during my Fall '23 semester. 
Although my Professor included a type of library of methods called "Paint" that helped us display things in Java, I used Java's library to challenge myself and display it in my own code.
This was a fun and good experience to explore more of Java's library and help understand the topics of Object Oriented Programming.
